# Weather Dashboard

## A program which allows the user to check weather conditions in cities around the globe! Simply type the name of your city, hit enter and see the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv index. The UV index is also dynamically color coded: green for low, orange for moderate, and red for high AKA please wear sunscreen. Weather Dashboard also includes a five-day forecast for the city of your choosing, including forecasted high temperatures, wind speed and humidity. This project forced me to work with thrid party APIs, something I didn't really understand before. Being "forged in fire" is stressful, however, "the fire" is a good teacher. This project has provided me with some good practice for my upcomming asignments, and I look forward to them. Thanks,                                                                                                                           and happy coding.
